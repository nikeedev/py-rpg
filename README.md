## Python rpg


//


## Requirements:
These Python versions: [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%20%7C%203.10-lime)](https://python.org/)
Download them from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**You must also have pygame installed using this command: `pip install pygame`**

**If install fails, because system doesnt find `pip` command, add `py ( or python3 if you are using UNIX system ) -m` to the beginning of pip command, so it looks like this: `py -m pip install pygame`( or python3)**
